<h1>Welcome To The Site Of Chris Abrams</h1>
<div class="FirstParagraph">
   
      
<p1>Currently I, Chris Abrams, am enrolled in a front-end web develpoment class where i 
    learned how to make this website.
    My first homework assignment was to create a multipage site that is demonstrating 
    my skills to my employers,  Relaxr, Startup Matchmaker, and CitiPix.
    I have instead created a site of a few of my intrests, but also what I have 
    learned from my front-end web develpment course.
    Throughout the site you will see buttons at the bottom of the page that will link you all over the place. 
    Feel free to visit the Contact Me page to leave your question and comments.
